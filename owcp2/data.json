The \"First Report of Injury\" measure tracks the time from the date of the injury or death, or the date of the employer's knowledge of the injury and the onset of disability, whichever is later, to the date the Longshore District Office receives the Employer's First Report of Injury (Form LS-202). The \"First Payment\" measure tracks the time it takes the employer or insurance carrier to issue the First Payment of Compensation after the worker becomes disabled for work or after the worker's death. Performance targets aim to increase the percentage of cases in which employers submit their First Reports of Injury and employers and carriers issue the First Payments of Compensation within 30 days.
