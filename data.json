The OES program collects data on wage and salary workers in nonfarm establishments in order to produce employment and wage estimates for about 800 occupations. Data from self-employed persons are not collected and are not included in the estimates. The OES program produces these occupational estimates by geographic area and by industry. Estimates based on geographic areas are available at the National, State, Metropolitan, and Nonmetropolitan Area levels. The Bureau of Labor Statistics produces occupational employment and wage estimates for over 450 industry classifications at the national level. The industry classifications correspond to the sector, 3-, 4-, and 5-digit North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) industrial groups.

CFOI is a Federal-State cooperative program that has been active in all 50 States and the District of Columbia since 1992. To compile counts that are as complete as possible, CFOI uses multiple sources to identify, \r\nverify, and profile fatal worker injuries. Information about each workplace fatal injury is obtained by cross referencing the source records, such as death certificates, workers' compensation reports, and Federal and State agency administrative reports. To ensure that fatal injuries are work-related, cases are substantiated with two or more independent source documents, or a source document and a follow-up questionnaire. CFOI publishes detailed data on case characteristics such as the event or exposure leading to the \r\nfatal injury, the source of the fatal injury, and worker activity at the time of the incident. Event or exposure, source, and other case characteristic codes are currently based on the BLS Occupational Injury and Illness Classification System (OIICS) 2.01, which can be viewed at our Web site at http://www.bls.gov/iif/oshoiics.htm.",

Designated the C-CPI-U, the index supplements the existing Consumer Price Indexes already produced by the BLS: the CPI for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) and the CPI for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). The C-CPI-U employs a Tornqvist formula and utilizes expenditure data in adjacent time periods in order to reflect the effect of any substitution that consumers make across item categories in response to changes in relative prices. The new measure is designed to be a closer approximation to a \"cost-of-living\" index than the present measures. The use of expenditure data for both a base period and the current period in order to average price change across item categories distinguishes the C-CPI-U from the existing CPI measures, which use only a single expenditure base period to compute the price change over \r\ntime.",

			"description": "The Department Store Inventory Price Index is an inventory weighted price index of goods carried by department stores, designed for use in preparing income tax returns by department stores. Group indexes are used by stores employing the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) Method of Accounting in conjunction with the Retail Inventory method. Treasury Decision No. 5605 (March 4, 1948) expressly permits, in accordance with certain principles laid down in the decision, the use of the Elective Inventory Method by Taxpayers employing the Retail Inventory Method. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is responsible for the technical accuracy of the index, but permission to use this index and the way in which it is used in tax returns is solely within the jurisdiction of the Internal Revenue Service.",

			"description": "The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a statistical measure of change, over time, of the prices of goods and services in major expenditure groups--such as food, housing, apparel, transportation, and medical care--typically purchased by urban consumers. Essentially, it compares the cost of a sample \"market basket\" of goods and services in a specific month relative to the cost of the same \"market basket\" in an earlier reference period. This reference period is designated as the base period. The revised CPI introduced by the BLS in 1998 includes indexes for two populations; urban wage earners and clerical workers (CW), and all urban consumers (CU). As a result of the revision, both the CW and the CU utilize updated expenditure weights based upon data tabulated from three years (1982, 1983, and 1984) of the Consumer Expenditure Survey and incorporate \r\na number of technical improvements, including an updated and revised item structure.",

Essentially, it compares the cost of a sample \"market basket\" of goods and services in a specific month relative to the cost of the same \"market basket\" in an earlier reference period. This reference period is designated as the base \r\nperiod. The CPI introduced by the BLS in 1987 includes indexes for two populations; urban wage earners and clerical workers (MW), and all urban consumers (MU).",

The statistical concepts and methods used in different countries are developed primarily to meet domestic rather than international needs. When there are substantial conceptual differences, BLS adjusts the data to improve comparability or describes the differences \r\nso users will not draw misleading conclusions. In adjusting data for greater comparability, BLS must depend on the availability of relevant information, and in some instances it is necessary to make estimates based on incomplete data. Therefore it is possible to achieve only approximate statistical comparability among countries.",

Labor input and capital services are combined using\r\nchained superlative Tornqvist aggregation, applying weights that represent each component's share of total costs. The chained superlative Tornqvist index uses changing weights; the share in each year is averaged with the preceding year's share. The multifactor productivity indexes are derived by dividing an output index by an index of the combined inputs of labor, capital services, energy, non-energy materials, and purchased business services. The output index for manufacturing is computed using a chained superlative index (Tornqvist) of three-digit NAICS industry outputs. Industry output is measured as sectoral output, the total value of goods and services leaving the industry.",

			"description": "In Fiscal Year 2010, the Longshore Division adopted a new set of performance measures aimed at improving program effectiveness by facilitating the prompt delivery of benefits to injured workers and their families. Two new performance measures target the timeliness of the Employer's First Report of Injury and the First Payment of Compensation, thereby improving initial claims processing and benefit delivery outcomes. The \"First Report of Injury\" measure tracks the time from the date of the injury or death, or the date of the employer's knowledge of the injury and the onset of disability, whichever is later, to the date the Longshore District Office receives the Employer's First Report of Injury (Form LS-202). The \"First Payment\" measure tracks the time it takes the employer or insurance carrier to issue the First Payment of Compensation after the worker becomes disabled for work or after the worker's death. Performance targets aim to increase the percentage of cases in which employers submit their First Reports of Injury and employers and carriers issue the First Payments of Compensation within 30 days. Performance results are shown in the tables below. The DBA performance measures were introduced in 2010, and the non-DBA measures in 2011.",
